## Executive Summary 
Executive Summary: This was interesting learning about OS, Python, and graphics.
## Python IDL: is an integrated development environment for Python, which has been bundled with the default implementation of the language. It is packaged as an optional part of the Python packaging with many Linux distributions. It is completely written in Python Integrated shell you can always know >>>. File editor allows you to do code editing.

## Code Examples:are variables, assignment statements, functions.
### Variable:Variable like names spam, eggs, and bacon==used from a video.
### Assignment statement:An Assignment statement is a statement that is used to set a value to the variable name in a program. Assignment statement allows a variable to hold different types of values during its program lifespan.
### Function:Mini programs in a program types:
### Three data:Print, input, and string.

## Graphics

### Raster vs. Vector GraphicsRaster is made of 1 million pixels so enlarging will blur image and Vector graphic image is a proffessional image and will not blur when enlarging image
### Lossless vs. Lossy CompressionAll data is present in lossless image and lossy comprehension all data not present.
### File FormatsGIF
•	If animation is required.
•	Line drawings and simple graphics.
JPEG
•	Photos, especially without high contrast.
•	Screenshots, especially of movies, games, or similar content.
PNG
•	Line art, illustrations.
•	Photos with high contrast.
•	Transparency, especially alpha channel transparency

### File Properties
File attributes are settings associated with computer files that grant or deny certain rights to how a user or the operating system can access that file. For example, IBM compatible computers running MS-DOS or Microsoft Windows have capabilities of having read, archive, system, and hidden attributes. 
        Name
You can rename the file by changing this field. You can also rename a file outside the properties window. Rename a file or folder.
Type
This helps you identify the type of the file, such as PDF document, OpenDocument Text, or JPEG image. The file type determines which applications can open the file, among other things. For example, you can’t open a picture with a music player. See Open files with other applications for more information on this.
The MIME type of the file is shown in parentheses; MIME type is a standard way that computers use to refer to the file type.
This field is displayed if you are looking at the properties of a folder rather than a file. It helps you see the number of items in the folder. If the folder includes other folders, each inner folder is counted as one item, even if it contains further items. Each file is also counted as one item. If the folder is empty, the contents will display nothing.
Size
This field is displayed if you are looking at a file (not a folder). The size of a file tells you how much disk space it takes up. This is also an indicator of how long it will take to download a file or send it in an email (big files take longer to send/receive).
Sizes may be given in bytes, KB, MB, or GB; in the case of the last three, the size in bytes will also be given in parentheses. Technically, 1 KB is 1024 bytes, 1 MB is 1024 KB and so on.
Parent Folder
The location of each file on your computer is given by its absolute path. This is a unique “address” of the file on your computer, made up of a list of the folders that you would need to go into to find the file. For example, if Jim had a file called Resume.pdf in his Home folder, its parent folder would be /home/jim and its location would be /home/jim/Resume.pdf.
Free Space
This is only displayed for folders. It gives the amount of disk space which is available on the disk that the folder is on. This is useful for checking if the hard disk is full.
Accessed
The date and time when the file was last opened.
Modified
The date and time when the file was last changed and saved.


## Conclusion
Conclusion: I cannot believe how much I know about OS, Python, and graphics.
